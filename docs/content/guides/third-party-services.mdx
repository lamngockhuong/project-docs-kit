# Third-Party Services Integration

This guide covers how to integrate external services such as payment gateways, analytics platforms or authentication providers.

## Selecting a Service
- Evaluate the reliability and pricing of the service.
- Confirm compatibility with the project's tech stack.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install the provider's SDK or library.
2. Configure required environment variables and credentials.
3. Follow the provider's documentation for initial setup steps.

## Example
```ts
import { ExampleSDK } from 'example-service';

const client = new ExampleSDK({ apiKey: process.env.EXAMPLE_API_KEY });

client.doSomething();
```

## Integrating Multiple Services

When your project relies on more than one provider, isolate each integration in
its own module or service. Keep credentials and configuration for each provider
separate to avoid conflicts. A common pattern is to create wrapper classes that
expose a unified interface to the rest of your codebase.

```ts
import { ExampleSDK } from 'example-service';
import { AnalyticsSDK } from 'analytics-service';

export const paymentClient = new ExampleSDK({
  apiKey: process.env.EXAMPLE_API_KEY,
});

export const analyticsClient = new AnalyticsSDK({
  apiKey: process.env.ANALYTICS_API_KEY,
});
```

## Best Practices
- Securely store API keys and secrets using environment variables.
- Keep third-party dependencies updated to avoid vulnerabilities.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide fallback logic when possible.
