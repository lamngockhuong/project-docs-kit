# Third-Party Services Integration

This guide covers how to integrate external services such as payment gateways, analytics platforms or authentication providers.

## Selecting a Service
- Evaluate the reliability and pricing of the service.
- Confirm compatibility with the project's tech stack.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install the provider's SDK or library.
2. Configure required environment variables and credentials.
3. Follow the provider's documentation for initial setup steps.

## Example
```ts
import { ExampleSDK } from 'example-service';

const client = new ExampleSDK({ apiKey: process.env.EXAMPLE_API_KEY });

client.doSomething();
```

## Best Practices
- Securely store API keys and secrets using environment variables.
- Keep third-party dependencies updated to avoid vulnerabilities.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide fallback logic when possible.
